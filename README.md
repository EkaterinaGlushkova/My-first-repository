# My-first-repository
This is my first repository which contains several files in which I described my quick start passing at 8base platform.

# My notes about quick start

Throughout my quick start I couldn't to do some things:

In paragraph 2.1 I was have an error, when I send a request of GraphQL mutation. After the copying of the request text, I swaped <YOUR_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_ADDRESS> to my email adress. But when I sended a request, I got a response with a message: "Records for current filter not found". However, after the passing of quick start, I tried to retry a request of this GraphQL mutation. And here it's goes! This mutation could to create a several dummy records to my database in my test workspace. Unfortunately I cound't to find an error why it didn't work early.

In paragraph 4 I decided to test two applications (depending of the framework vue or react). In using the vue.js starting app, all steps goes fine and I could to test a starter application. But when I use react.js starting app I had some error. Here are the steps which I does:

- clone the project at github to my local folder

- fill in the template of the .env.local file with all appropriate values

- install dependencies (npm install)

- boot up a starter app (npm start)

After the last step I saw a message in the CLI: "failed to compile"

Notes:

- the file "package-lock.json" which was cloned have a git status "modified"

- the template of .env.local file don't have a variable "VUE_APP_WORKSPACE_ID"

In my own opinion the quick start guide is well written and easy to read.

I noted my proposals to improve the product in "Feature_requests.xlsx" file and bug reports which I created was be noted in the four "Bug_report_....xlsx" files. All this files are located in repository named "My first repository" on Github.
